# Spooky.Best (Initial Source) Leak
**Initial** Source leak for Spooky.best mod menu. The Spooky project was made after the towel was thrown in for SpookiMystic which was originally based out of nano42 and as you can see the later versions as well as the "new" menu has been made using big base v1. When Spooky first released it was pretty stripped down from the original version, a lot of the features were commented out, you can compare the current features and updated ones with the originals. It is pretty standard, not a lot of hooks or really any outstanding features or protections, it was made for the simple users but seemingly overpriced originally. So obviously when it was given there were more features than what they released but it ended up being stripped down a lot. There are some detected things like the "stealth" in there. 

## Why?
I'm really tired of keeping this on my pc, and I really want nothing more to do with it, the people, etc. There were a lot of arguments and claims that were made and a lot of uneeded hostility which turned into threatening the source to abate conflicts which in itself is kind of toxic, so at this point it's just better to get rid of and forget it. Don't ask me for credits I'm  not sure who added, what was added to and by whom and when or for what reason or at what version...etc. I'm just releasing it because technically I had ownership of it, consider it a self leak of a conglomeration of a master of work(s).

_**Version At Release:**_ Patch 1.50

## Controversy
Keep in mind this section wasn't supposed to be here. This was merely a stripped down release, why? Because the person who cared didn't seem to care if it was spread around, most of this stuff you can find, out of consideration I removed a lot and made some stuff re-useable. If you want I can add some of that back as well as fix things, improve and expand on some items. The owners or whatever made it quite clear that they are more insterested in useless squander. Here is some shit.

## What May Need Updated?
* Crossmaps
* Reclass structs
* Events and Protections
* Maybe? minor sigs

## Don't
* Use the protections, it's literally just defusing events. It's 2020 get creative.
* Use the events without updating, them it's not hard. I made a post on UC as well as even updated all those + more.
* Wonder why your vehicles aren't spawning in the right place, fix vector3 first. Look at BBV2.
* Re-use and skid this, although it's gonna happen so do what you want.
* Cause uneeded drama, this is being leaked cause I don't need this around not to destroy it or anything.
* Spam this or mass spread this, that is annoying...
